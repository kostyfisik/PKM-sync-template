# Quick start

See:
- [[chore.pkm.installation]] for setup instructions,
- [[chore.pkm.showcase]] for examples of supported features.
- [[chore.pkm.interop]] for instructions to switch between programs
  for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).
- [[chore.pkm.limitations]] for usage guidelines.
- [[chore.pkm.settings]] my settings on top of required minimum.


# Objective

The objective is to create a durable note-taking system that is
designed to last. In order to achieve this, I would like to organize
my notes in a way that allows me to use them in multiple personal
knowledge management (PKM) programs at the same time, or with minimal
effort required to switch between programs.


# Rational
  
I am looking for a note-taking solution that is future-proof,
portable, and convenient. Traditional paper notes are not portable or
convenient as they accumulate, so I have found that using a computer
system is more robust. However, over the years, I have experienced
losses as computer systems evolve and vendors come and go. Therefore,
I have chosen plain text formats like Markdown or LaTeX for my
computer note format. These formats are easy to use, maintain, and
have been around for decades. Text files do not rely on any specific
vendor's services, and they can be easily backed up and synced across
devices, including the cloud. Plain text files can be accessed and
navigated with minimal or no specialized software, they are also
friendly to version control systems like Git. However, having
specialized software for personal knowledge management (PKM) adds
convenience, so I would like to have one. 
 

Currently, I am considering several software packages for note-taking
and PKM (see [[chore.pkm.selection]] for details). I would like to use
them together, using the same note files and being able to switch
between them without much additional work. For my permanent knowledge
notes, I prefer to use as few features as possible to keep them
portable and durable. However, I can tolerate losing some ongoing
"work-in-progress" notes over time, as I make use of convenient
features from each software. This mainly relates to ongoing project
management, to-do lists, structuring complex topics as "note
prototypes," floating notes, and other things that may become
irrelevant in short-term period of time. In general, I agree with
Anders Thoresson's sentiment of prioritizing the longevity of my notes
collection over features and user experience. You can read more about
it in his blog post
[here](https://myttl.blog/what-is-the-exit-plan-for-your-notes-2/).

I also hope that if my note system is interoperable between multiple
PKM programs, I will be able to adapt it to new software as it
emerges, ensuring continued productivity even if any of the chosen
products become obsolete. For example, since Dendron is no longer
actively developed as of late 2022, I am searching for a more
future-proof format for my notes.


# Opinionated settings
  
It is an opinionated setup, but you have the freedom to modify it by
forking and personalizing it according to your preferences. However,
it would be great if you could share any changes you make that enhance
compatibility with the mentioned PKM software or introduce new ones to
the existing list.

See [[chore.pkm.settings]] for more details.


# Compatibility Limitation

To ensure compatibility, there are certain rules that limit the use of advanced features that are specific to different PKM programs. For more information, refer to [[chore.pkm.limitations]].
