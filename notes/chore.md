# Quick start

See:
- [[chore.pkm.installation]] for setup instructions,
- [[chore.pkm.showcase]] for examples of supported features.
- [[chore.pkm.interop]] for instructions to switch between programs
  for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM).
- [[chore.pkm.limitations]] for usage guidelines.
- [[chore.pkm.settings]] my settings on top of required minimum.

# Rational
  
I am looking for a note-taking solution that is future-proof,
portable, and convenient. While traditional paper notes are not
portable or convenient as they accumulate, I have found that using a
computer system is more robust. Howeverver, over the years, I have
experienced losses as computer systems evolve and vendors come and go.
Therefore, I have chosen plain text formats like Markdown or LaTeX for
my computer note format. These formats are easy to use, maintain, and
have been around for decades. Text files do not rely on any specific
vendor's services, and they can be easily backed up and synced across
devices, including the cloud. Plain text files can be accessed and
navigated with minimal or no specialized software. However, having
specialized software for personal knowledge management (PKM) adds
convenience, so I would like to have one. 
 

Currently, I am considering several software packages for note-taking
and PKM (see [[chore.pkm.selection]] for details). I would like to use
them together, using the same note files and being able to switch
between them without much additional work. For my permanent knowledge
notes, I prefer to use as few features as possible to keep them
portable and durable. However, I can tolerate losing some ongoing
"work-in-progress" notes over time, as I make use of convenient
features from each software. This mainly relates to ongoing project
management, to-do lists, structuring complex topics as "note
prototypes," and other things that may become irrelevant in the
future. In general, I agree with Anders Thoresson's sentiment of
prioritizing the longevity of my notes collection over features and
user experience. You can read more about it in his blog post
[here](https://myttl.blog/what-is-the-exit-plan-for-your-notes-2/).

I also hope that if my note system is interoperable between multiple
PKM programs, I will be able to adapt it to new software as it
emerges, ensuring continued productivity even if any of the chosen
products become obsolete. For example, since Dendron is no longer
actively developed as of late 2022, I am searching for a more
future-proof format for my notes.

# Opinionated settings
  
It is an opinionated setup, but you are welcome to make
changes by forking and customizing it. However, it would be
appreciated if you could contribute back any changes that improve
compatibility with the mentioned PKM software or add new ones to the
list.

See [[chore.pkm.settings]] for more details.

# Compatibility Limitation

To keep interoperability there is a number of rules that restrict
usage of advanced features that are unique or have a distinct
implementation in various PKM programs, see [[chore.pkm.limitations]]
