# Opinionated settings

## No folders/directories

Two major options are to use folders (directories) provided by your
filesystem or not to use.


## Font

I prefer using a dark theme and the [JetBrains
Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) monospace font for
consistency across all PKMs. Note, the JetBrains Mono font is free and
open-source. 

## Hotkeys 

I utilize the  `Alt + .`  and  `Alt +` ,  hotkeys for forward and backward
navigation. The keyboard keycups for  `.`  and  `,`  also have  `>`  and  `<`
symbols on them, making it easy to remember. These keys are located
close to the right  `Alt`  button, making them easily accessible. I have
made some minor tweaks to the keyboard shortcuts to make them more
similar to those in VS Code, which is my default choice of the text editor.
 

## Line length

I prefer a limit of 66 symbols per line for optimal readability, as
recommended by Bringhurst, R. in "The Elements of Typographic Style"
(1992). Research conducted by Dyson, M. C., & Haselgrove, M. (2001) in
the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies suggests that a
line length of 55 symbols is most effective for reading. However, the
size of the focus group in their research is unclear. 
 
In the context of coding standards and traditions, 55 symbols may not
be sufficient. The popular choice is to have a limit of 80 symbols per
line, as seen in PEP-8. Occasionally, a limit of 120 symbols per line
is considered acceptable for coding. 
 
Thus, the general consensus is that a line length ranging from 50 to 75
symbols is acceptable. Therefore, I will adhere to a maximum of 70
symbols per line. This should provide an average close to the optimal
66 symbols and align with most recommendations.
