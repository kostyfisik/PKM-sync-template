# Objective

The objective of this template is to create a long-lasting note-taking
system. To achieve this, I aim to organize my notes in a manner that
allows me to use them in multiple personal knowledge management (PKM)
programs simultaneously or with minimal effort when switching between
programs.

# Quick start

Open the root directory of the project to use:
  - `Dendron` plugin in `VS Code`  

Open `notes` directory as a vault to use:
  - `Obsidian`
  - `Foam` plugin in `VS Code`

# Tested Programs

I have tested the following programs to ensure they can work in sync
using the same note files:
- Obsidian
- Foam
- Logseq (read-only mode)
- Dendron

By following some basic rules, it is possible to switch between PKM
programs almost effortlessly.
